##Sampling Strategy for KPI poverty and SLU 

###Countries: Burundi, DRC (South Kivu), and Rwanda

The major objective of the survey is two-fold. First, to evaluate the impact of CIALCA interventions on development outcomes (poverty and NRM) in the target countries. Second, to establish a baseline upon which to measure the impact of Humidtropics (HT) interventions on key development outcomes. Since HT field sites cover the CIALCA mandate areas and the activities of HT are complementing the CIALCA activities, the sampling procedure of households is as given by CIALCA (Macharia et al. 2011; Ouma et al. 2011) with slight modifications on selection of control villages. 

The control villages will be selected from within and outside the HT field sites. The control villages within HT sites will be those selected by CIALCA. These control sites latter will serve three purposes: i) to measure the impact of CIALCA activities, ii) to provide baseline values for HT activities, and iii) to act as treatment villages for HT. Since HT activities cannot be implemented in all villages within the HT field sites at the same time, the control villages within field sites will be used to measure the impact of HT activities with spillover effects while the control villages outside HT field sites will be used to measure the ‘pure’ impact of HT activities. The spillover effects will be measured as a differential impact between the impact determined using control villages within HT field sites and the impact determined using control villages outside HT field sites. The spillover effects will provide insights on the spread of HT impacts on a broader scale.

Due to limited resources, a subsample of CIALCA baseline households will be selected. The selection of the subsample will be based on: i) The locations which have been identified by HT as the initial entry points for establishing R4D platforms and implementing HT activities. These locations include South Kivu for DRC, Eastern and North province for Rwanda, and Gitega, Cibitoke and Kirundo for Burundi. ii) The distribution of sample sizes of baseline households per village where CIALCA action sites or satellite sites were established. Villages with large baseline sample sizes will be selected to minimize the attrition due to either failure to locate some households which participated in the baseline study in 2006 or the household’s refusal to participate in the study.

Using the selection criteria described above, a random subsample of 400 households which participated in the CIALCA baseline study from each country will be targeted. This subsample provides a fairly good representation of the total baseline sample in South Kivu (86%), Burundi (81%) and Eastern Rwanda (65%). In addition to the baseline subsample, in each country 100 households will be use as control and will be selected outside CIALCA and HT sites. The selection of these external control sites will follow the sampling procedure used by HT. Overall, 1,500 households will participate in the study from the three countries.

In addition to household surveys, a ‘light’ community survey will be conducted in each of the selected villages to collect information on the characterization of the target (CIALCA) agricultural technologies. Precisely, community surveys will be intended to identify the technologies (e.g., crop varieties) commonly used by households within the village and source of the technologies.
